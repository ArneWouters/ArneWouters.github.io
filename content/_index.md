# Hey there!

I'm Arne, a software engineer from Belgium, now living and working in the vibrant city of
Amsterdam. Currently, I’m part of an amazing team at AWS, where I contribute to Amazon Q,
an exciting project leveraging AI. This website is my little corner of the internet —
a place where I share my thoughts, document my journey, and reflect on the things I’m learning.

# Now

Here's what I currently spend my time on
- Trying to finish [*"A Philosophy of Software Design"*](https://books.google.nl/books/about/A_Philosophy_of_Software_Design.html?id=hkfEzgEACAAJ) by John Ousterhout
- Playing with [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) on my linux desktop
